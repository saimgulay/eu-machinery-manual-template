# Legal basis and evidence approach

This repository is a documentation template and traceability framework for industrial machinery instructions.
It is not legal advice.

## Primary EU legal sources (machinery instructions)
1) Directive 2006/42/EC (Machinery Directive)
- Annex I, §1.7.4 "Instructions" and §1.7.4.2 "Contents of the instructions" are the primary checklist for what the instructions must contain.

2) Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 (Machinery Regulation)
- Repeals and replaces Directive 2006/42/EC. It applies from 20 January 2027 (with some provisions applying earlier).
- It reinforces requirements on availability and language of instructions and introduces additional expectations (e.g., access to EU Declaration of Conformity information).

## Supporting standards (documentation and safety method)
- IEC/IEEE 82079-1: Preparation of information for use — principles and general requirements.
- ISO 20607: Safety of machinery — instruction handbook — general drafting principles.
- ISO 12100: Safety of machinery — general principles for design — risk assessment and risk reduction.

## Evidence-based concept (how this repo works)
A manual is only as strong as the evidence that supports it. This repo enforces:
- A compliance matrix mapping every legal requirement item to the manual section(s) that fulfil it.
- Evidence packs (timestamped snapshots) containing the artefacts that back claims and instructions:
  - risk assessment summary
  - verification/test logs
  - drawings/diagrams referenced by the manual
  - label artwork and placement
  - translation and review artefacts (where applicable)
- SHA-256 hashes for evidence-pack files to provide tamper-evidence and reproducibility.

## Practical note
Your applicable obligations depend on:
- machine category and intended use,
- user group (professional/non-professional),
- Member State language requirements,
- applicable harmonised standards selected,
- conformity assessment route and technical file completeness.

Use this template to structure your documentation and traceability, then validate with competent compliance professionals.
