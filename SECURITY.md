# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This repository contains documentation templates and helper scripts. We accept security reports for:
- scripts under `/scripts` (if they could be abused in typical usage)
- GitHub Actions workflows (if they introduce security risk)

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do NOT open a public issue for sensitive security problems.

Instead:
1) Open a GitHub issue with minimal details and label it "security" if possible, OR
2) Contact the maintainer via GitHub profile contact channels.

We will acknowledge receipt and aim to provide a fix or mitigation guidance.
