# Evidence-Based EU Machinery Instructions Template (CE)

**Live docs:** https://saimgulay.github.io/eu-machinery-manual-template/

## DOCX version
- Location: docs/MANUAL_TEMPLATE_EN.docx
- Source of truth: docs/MANUAL_TEMPLATE_EN.md

### Developer note (keep MD and DOCX in sync)
The Markdown template is the source of truth. If you change the MD, you MUST regenerate the DOCX so both stay consistent.

Recommended regeneration (best fidelity):
- Use Pandoc if available:
  - pandoc -f gfm -t docx -o docs/MANUAL_TEMPLATE_EN.docx docs/MANUAL_TEMPLATE_EN.md

Fallback regeneration (no Pandoc):
- Use Python + python-docx (see the conversion approach used in this repo's commit history).


This repository provides an evidence-based template for industrial machinery instructions/user manual documentation.
It includes:
- A manual template aligned to the EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC Annex I §1.7.4 (Instructions) and the EU Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 (notably language/accessibility and Annex III information).
- A compliance matrix that maps each required information item to manual sections.
- Evidence-pack folder structure, evidence index and compliance report templates.
- Simple scripts to create timestamped evidence packs and generate SHA-256 hashes for traceability.

## Scope
- Target: industrial machinery instructions (user/operator + maintenance info as applicable).
- Output format: Markdown (easy export to PDF/Word/Pages; works with docs-as-code workflows).

## Key legal references (primary)
- Directive 2006/42/EC, Annex I, §1.7.4 "Instructions".
- Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 on machinery (repeals 2006/42/EC; applies from 20 January 2027, with some earlier articles).

> Keep in mind: requirements can vary by machine category, intended users, and Member State language rules.
> This repo is a documentation template and traceability framework — not a legal opinion.

## How to use (quick start)
1. Copy `docs/MANUAL_TEMPLATE_EN.md` and rename it for your product.
2. Fill the tokens (see `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`).
3. Create an evidence pack:
   - macOS/Linux: `scripts/new_evidence_pack.sh "my_machine_model"`
   - Windows PowerShell: `scripts/new_evidence_pack.ps1 -ProductSlug "my_machine_model"`
4. Populate the evidence pack with:
   - Risk assessment summary, test logs, drawings, warnings inventory, translation artefacts.
5. Fill `docs/COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md` and produce `docs/COMPLIANCE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Repository conventions
- Every released manual version SHOULD have:
  - A matching evidence pack under `evidence/_packs/<timestamp>_<slug>/`
  - A SHA-256 hash list (generated by `scripts/make_hashes.py`)
  - A compliance report (filled template) referencing evidence artefacts by relative path + hash.
